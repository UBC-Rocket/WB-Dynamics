function q_dot = quat_dot(omega, q)
%QUAT_DOT Computes derivative of quaternion with respect to time.
%   Given an angular velocity omega in the form of [x,y,z], the derivative
%   of q which is in the form of [x,y,z,w] is computed
%
%   Input:
%       omega : angular velocity in radians
%       q     : quaternion in the form of [x,y,z,w]
%   Ouput:
%       q_dot : derivative of q with respect to time

%   To keep it an unit quaternion, an extra factor is added although it is
%   recommended to re-normalize the quaternion after each integration cycle.
