function f_gravity = f_g(m, p)
%F_G Compute gravitational force of Earth on a mass
%   The earth is assumed to be a perfect sphere.
%
%   Input:
%       m         : mass in kg
%       p         : distance from surface of the Earth in meters
%   Ouput:
%       f_gravity : force of gravity exerted on mass
%
% Gravitational constant obtained from:
% Atmospheric and Space Flight Dynamics Modeling and Simulation with MATLABÂ® 
% by Ashish Tewari

    G = 6.67259e-11;    % Gravitational constant
    M_e = 5.972e24;     % Mass of Earth in kg
    r = 6371000;        % Volumetric mean radius of Earth in meters
