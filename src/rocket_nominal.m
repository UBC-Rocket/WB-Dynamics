function vehicle = rocket_nominal(input_file)
% Generates a MATLAB struct that contains all the static
% properties of a rocket from a file. 
%   There isn't any fine control on
%   what happens to each field which suggests that perhaps
%   an object oriented approach would perhaps be better in
%   the future. At the moment we are all "consenting programmers"
%   and we know what we are doing.
%
%   Additional note: There might be a better way that can do this assignment

%       Uncertainties:
%           Since variables such as thrust, center of gravity, center of
%           pressure and vehicle coefficent of drag is complex in nature so
%           instead of varying each dependent variable (which makes it
%           computationally expensive) we scale the final result by a
%           factor that is determined by sampling.
%
%           thrust_uncertainty: struct with the fields `var` and `rand`
%               where `var` is the percentage error of the total thrust
%               and `rand` is a random number sampled from a distribution
%               with a lower bound of -1 and an upper bound of 1.
%           CG_uncertainty: struct with the fields `var` and `rand`
%               where `var` is the percentage error of the CG
%               and `rand` is a random number sampled from a distribution
%               with a lower bound of -1 and an upper bound of 1.
%           CP_uncertainty: struct with the fields `var` and `rand`
%               where `var` is the percentage error of the CP
%               and `rand` is a random number sampled from a distribution
%               with a lower bound of -1 and an upper bound of 1.
%           CD_uncertainty: struct with the fields `var` and `rand`
%               where `var` is the percentage error of the total vehicle CD
%               and `rand` is a random number sampled from a distribution
%               with a lower bound of -1 and an upper bound of 1.
%       Since this is using nominal values, the uncertainties are set to
%       zero.

    % The majority of the properties are already stored in this struct. The
    % next few lines aims to add a couple extra that are not explictly
    % specified by the input file.
