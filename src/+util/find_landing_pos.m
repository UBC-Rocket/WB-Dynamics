%FIND_LANDING_POS Finding landing position of vehicle given launch altitude
%and trajectory.
%   Uses Newton's method to iteratively find the zero (landing position).

%   pages 17-18 are the most relevant.
%
%   Input:
%       time: vector of time stamps
%       state: matrix of states at each time stamp. Should match the state
%           return value of the `trajectory` function
%       launch_alt: Launch altitude above sea level in meters
%   Ouput:
%       pos_x: x position of landing point in meters
%       pos_y: y position of landing point in meters
%       landing_time: time in seconds since ignition to land

    altitude = state(:,3);
    pp = spline(time, altitude); % Cubic piecewise polynomial
    % Since we want to find the time values where the altitude data points
    % intersects with the line altitude = launch_alt, the function altitude
    % vs time can be vertically shifted down by launch_alt which then
    % transforms the problem to a easier problem of finding where the
    % transformed function intersects the time axis which can be done
    % iteratively via Newton's method.
    pp.coefs(:,4) = pp.coefs(:,4) - launch_alt;
    
    %% Compute derivative of `pp`
    coefs = zeros(size(pp.coefs, 1), 4); % Initialize matrix to store values
    coefs(:,1) = zeros(size(pp.coefs, 1), 1); % derivative of cubic has no x^3 term
    coefs(:,2) = 3*pp.coefs(:,1); % quadratic term is 3*x^2
    coefs(:,3) = 2*pp.coefs(:,2); % linear term is 2*x
    coefs(:,4) = pp.coefs(:,3); % constant term is x
    pp_dot = mkpp(pp.breaks, coefs); % Derivative of pp
    
    %% Perform Newton's method
    % Since the trajectory is somewhat parabolic in nature, there will be
    % two zeros, one at ignition (time = 0) and one at landing time. The
    % latter is what we are looking for so we set the initial time guess to
    % be farther away from zero (an arbitrary choice of 3/4 of the total
    % simulation time is chosen to the the initial time guess) to make sure
    % we don't "accidently" get the ignition time.
    x = time(length(time))*0.75;
